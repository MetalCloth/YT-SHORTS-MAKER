    ```
3.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" python-dotenv unrealspeech requests ffmpeg-python python-multipart
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your API key:
    ```
    UNREAL_SPEECH_API_KEY="your_unrealspeech_api_key_here"
    ```

### Frontend Setup
